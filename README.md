# Godotspace

Is an attempt to make a workable 3d space flight sim in godot.

It would be real nice if it could end up similar to any of its inspirations, but just being able to fly around would also be nice

## Inspirations:

*  TIE Fighter and Freespace 2

    * Scripted missions, less complex flight model

*  Elite Dangerous

    * Nothing specific, but every time I play E:D I just really want to stop and go make my own flight sim instead, so here we are
